		<p>For our final project, we wanted to write a small set of applets that demonstrates various algorithms from our class. Unfortunately we only completed two: Duality and Orthogonal Range Trees. The preliminary code for Voronoi Diagrams and kdTrees can still be found. Dizhe was the preliminary programmer for the Duality code and Qihan focused on the Range Query applet. Both applets are written in Javasript and HTML5, which is supported on Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer 7 or later. The code was primarily written and tested in Chrome, so other web browsers might have bugs. We chose to use HTML5 due to its portability and strong support in modern web browsers. Furthermore, it is very stable when using ctrl zoom functions in web browsers. The applet can be placed in a webpage by using the "embed" tag as above.</p>
		<p>Each applet is placed in its own tab and doesn't influence the other applet. The basic usage for the two applets are as follows. Clicking on the canvas adds a point to that location. While you hover over that point, it is highlighted in red. Clicking that point again removes the point. Clicking and dragging the point moves it around the canvas. The clear button removes the points and all related data.</p>

		<h2>Duality</h2>
		<p></p>
		</br>
		<h2>Orthogonal Range Trees</h2>
		<p>As you add points to the primary canvas (the large one on the left), the x range tree is drawn on the right. Hovering over a node in the x range tree displays the y range tree for that node and colors all its child nodes in green. In addition, the range of the node is drawn in the primary canvas in green and all points in the range is colored red. Clicking on the node in the x range tree "locks" it in and it will be displayed when you move your cursor. To clear a locked in node, click anywhere in the x range tree that doesn't have a node. Adding, removing, or moving a point also unlocks the node. While a node in the x range tree is locked in, you can move the cursor to the y range tree to see the ranges of the nodes in the y range tree. Both the x range tree and y range tree have a tendency to expand beyond the size of the canvas. If it does, you can click and drag the canvas to move the tree around.</p>
		<p>Hovering over a point in the primary canvas colors its equivalent leaf node in both the x range tree and y range tree to red. Clicking and dragging from an area without a point selects a range to query and draws it in blue. The nodes in the x tree and y tree that are used for the query is colored blue. In addition, the borders of the nodes used for the query is drawn.</p>
